# SteamBrowserHome
A homepage designed for the Steam Overlay Web Browser, targetted at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players

## Goals
- Lightweight (Minimal CPU/RAM usage) to avoid impacting CS's performance as much as possible
- Small, to avoid lag where possible
- Useful, should provide more features than using Google or another search engine as your homepage, and more features tailored to CS (mostly links to other useful sites)
- More may be added
